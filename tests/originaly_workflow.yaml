Because I have been adding a deleting a lot of things, I don't want to lose this
working copy of the yaml file. 


workflow:
  jobs:
    a:
      label: job-1-label
      kind: local
      user: gregor
      host: localhost
      status: ready
      progress: 0
      created: '2022-07-10 17:15:48.923232'
      modified: '2022-07-10 17:15:48.923232'
      script: test-a.sh
      instance: null
      name: a
    b:
      label: job-2-label
      kind: local
      user: gregor
      host: localhost
      status: ready
      progress: 0
      created: '2022-07-10 17:15:48.924201'
      modified: '2022-07-10 17:15:48.924201'
      script: test-a.sh
      instance: null
      name: b
  dependencies: {}
