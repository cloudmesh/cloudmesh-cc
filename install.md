We use fastapi as teh webserver with uvicorn.  To install it, the newest versions of FastAPI are partially implemented in rust.
Thus you will need to install rust on your machine with 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```


Then

```bash
cloudmesh-installer --ssh get cc
```

After it is installed, please use 

```bash
mkdir cm
cd cm
pip install cloudmesh-installer
cloudmesh-installer get cc
```
