## Background

High performance computing (HPC) has recently become a very important
part of science. Through processing on a supercomputer, programs can
run at previously unobtainable high speeds. HPC is typically used for
analytic programs that use large data sets and machine learning to
predict future values or to model current states. For such
high-complexity projects, there are often multiple complex programs
that may be ran several times for higher performance, like in deep
learning algorithms. With such projects, program execution is
submitted as a job to a typically remote HPC centers
such as UVA's Rivanna, where time is billed as node-hours. It is
necessary for such projects to have a service that lets the user
manage and execute without supervision. We have created a service that
lets the user run jobs across multiple platforms in a dynamic queue
with visualization and data storage.

## Current Work

This software was developed using Cloudmesh, a repository
that provides numerous methods of interfacing the local system with
cloud services. Much of the software from the hybrid multi-cloud
analytics service framework was developed from Cloudmesh repositories.

### Workflow

A hybrid multi-cloud analytics service framework was created to manage
heterogeneous and remote workflows, queues, and jobs.  It was designed
for access through both the command line and browser GUI REST services
to simplify the coordination of tasks on remote computers.  In
addition, this service supports multiple operating systems like MacOS,
Linux, and Windows 10 and 11, on various hosts: the computer's
localhost, remote computers, and the Linux-based virtual image WSL.
Jobs can be visualized and saved as a YAML and SVG data file. This
workflow was extensively tested for functionality and reproducibility.

### MNIST

The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology Database
is a machine learning database based on image processing Various MNIST
files involving different machine learning cases were modified and
tested on various local and remote machines These cases include
Multilayer Perceptron, LSTM (Long short-term
memory), Auto-Encoder, Convolutional and Recurrent Neural
Networks, Distributed Training, and PyTorch training

## Design

The hybrid multi-cloud analytics service framework was
created to ensure the optimal user experience for running jobs across
many platforms. From the bottom up, there are a plethora of Python
objects that were created to ensure execution of the jobs. These are
the database, job, graph, and workflow objects along with the frontend
service itself. The databases that were produced relied on a
previously implemented service called YamlDB: it allows for persistent
storage of data that users can call upon at the time of their
choosing, rather than simply storing in a machine's memory. Therefore,
when the jobs are run, the updated status and progress fields of the
job are saved. These saved values can then be used to create graphical
visuals as desired. Next, job objects were created so that programs
could be run on different machines. These objects allow the users to
be able to execute their jobs on different machines. For instance, we
have a local job, a WSL job, a Slurm job, and an SSH job (which was
primarily used for Rivanna). When a workflow is created, there is an
internal structure that identifies the type of machine that is being
operated on and creates the correct job based on that machine. After
the job, a graph class was created to mesh with the workflow. The
graph creates a node and edge graph with a corresponding visual
representation of the graph. This was to allow the user to visualize
where they are in the workflow. Next the workflow itself allows users
to add jobs, remove jobs, add edges, and then run each of the jobs in
the order that was specified. This allows the user to interact with
each of the previous objects. Finally, the service itself is a FastAPI
implementation of the workflow. Users can access this through their
own devices, they can add, remove jobs, and run jobs through a
graphical user interface. This interface can be run through command
line commands as created in the `cloudmesh-cc` repository.

### Summary

Users interact with a graphical user interface to create
workflows of jobs, which are scripts that run specific
experiments. This graphical user interface shows users where their
jobs are in the process of completion and create output files for each
job. With this framework, researchers and scientists should be able to
create jobs on their own, place them in the workflow, and run them on
various types of computers.

## Future Work

There are a few aspects of the service that could be improved. For
instance, the FastAPI section of the service could be improved to have
a more user-friendly graphical interface. This could be accomplished
by integrating what we learned through FastAPI with a different
frontend framework, such as Django or flask.

Regarding the workflow, major cleanup is needed. This could be done by
streamlining variables and creating better documentation so future
users and programmers can use the service.

With these changes, the service could be vastly improved. In the
future, we would like researchers to be able to easily access the code
and to have success stories with their experiments. Additionally, we
would like external users to report what they found useful and not
useful about the service so that we can more craft better solutions in
the future.
