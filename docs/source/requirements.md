# Requirements

To use cloudmesh-cc, the user must first follow the 
[Installation](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-cc/installation.html)
page.

Additionally, when running scripts/jobs inside a workflow, the scripts must 
leverage some format of cloudmesh.progress to run successfully. 
Otherwise, the Workflow class cannot tell
if the scripts are done, breaking the progress functionality.

The examples that are provided with cloudmesh-cc are
already augmented with cloudmesh.progress. Thus, if a user is
running self-made jobs and workflows, they must adhere to the
guidelines as follows.

## Shell and Slurm Scripts

For shell and Slurm scripts `.sh`, the script must contain:

```bash
echo "# cloudmesh status=running progress=1 pid=$$"
```

at the beginning of the script, and

```bash
echo "# cloudmesh status=done progress=100 pid=$$"
```

at the end of the script.

## Python Scripts and Jupyter Notebooks

For Python scripts `.py` and Jupyter notebooks `.ipynb`,
the script must contain an import module from 
cloudmesh.common and calls to the progress function.

py_script.py

```bash
from cloudmesh.common.StopWatch import progress
from cloudmesh.common.Shell import Shell
filename = Shell.map_filename('./py_script.log').path
progress(progress=1, filename=filename)

# your script does what you want it to do here...

progress(progress=100, filename=filename)
```

The statements do not need to be at the absolute beginning
or end of the script, but the progress must:

- be written to a filename with the same name as the script,
ending in `.log`
- begin at progress=1
- and end at progress=100
