# Contributing

All contributions will be done
under the apache license. The code will be managed
in open-source. Pull requests need to be made in
the repository. The main branch is the release
branch. Contributions will first be done in other
branches, and once we agree that they need to be
integrated into the code, they will be merged into
main. All new code must have sufficient pytests.
The pytests may need to be documented in case
special authentication is required.

We follow a [typical GitHub workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) 
of:

- create a personal fork of this repo
- create a branch
- open a pull request
- fix findings of various linters and checks
- work through code review

For each pull request, the documentation is built 
and deployed to make it easier to review the changes 
in the PR.
