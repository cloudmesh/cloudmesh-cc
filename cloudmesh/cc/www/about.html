<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>High-performance computing (HPC) is for decades a very important
tool for science. Scientific tasks can be leveraging the processing power of a supercomputer so they can
run at previously unobtainable high speeds or utilize specialized hardware for acceleration that otherwise are not available to the user. HPC can be used for
analytic programs that leverage machine learning applied to large data sets to,
for example, predict future values or to model current states. For such
high-complexity projects, there are often multiple complex programs
that may be running repeatedly in either competition or cooperation. Leveraging for example computational GPUs
leads to several times higher performance when applied to deep
learning algorithms. With such projects, program execution is
submitted as a job to a typically remote HPC center, where time is billed as node hours. Such projects must have a service that lets the user
manage and execute without supervision. We have created a service that
lets the user run jobs across multiple platforms in a dynamic queue
with visualization and data storage.</p>

<h2 id="workflow-controlled-computing">Workflow Controlled Computing</h2>
<p>This software was developed end enhancing Cloudmesh, a suite of software to make using cloud and HPC resources easier. Specifically, we have added
a library called Cloudmesh Controlled Computing (cloudmesh-cc) that adds workflow features to control the execution of jobs on remote compute resources.</p>
<p>The goal is to provide numerous methods of specifying the workflows on a local computer and running them on remote services such as HPC and cloud computing resources. This includes REST services and command line tools. The software developed is freely available and can easily be installed with standard python tools so integration in the python ecosystem using virtualenv and anaconda is simple.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-functionality">Workflow Functionality</h2>
<p>A hybrid multi-cloud analytics service framework was created to manage
heterogeneous and remote workflows, queues, and jobs. It was designed
for access through both the command line and REST services
to simplify the coordination of tasks on remote computers. In
addition, this service supports multiple operating systems like macOS,
Linux, and Windows 10 and 11, on various hosts: the computer;s
localhost, remote computers, and the Linux-based virtual image WSL.
Jobs can be visualized and saved as a YAML and SVG data file. This
workflow was extensively tested for functionality and reproducibility.</p>
<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>
<p>To test the workflow program, prepare a cm directory in your home
directory by executing the following commands in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> ~
<span class="hljs-built_in">mkdir</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">cm</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">cm</span>
pip install cloudmesh-installer -U
cloudmesh-installer <span class="hljs-built_in">get</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">cc</span>
git clone http<span class="hljs-variable">s:</span>//github.<span class="hljs-keyword">com</span>/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-<span class="hljs-keyword">cc</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> cloudmesh-<span class="hljs-keyword">cc</span>
pip install -<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span> .
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -v -<span class="hljs-keyword">x</span> --capture=<span class="hljs-keyword">no</span> tests/test_080_workflow_clean.<span class="hljs-keyword">py</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This test runs three jobs within a singular workflow: the first job runs a
local shell script, the second runs a local Python script, and the third
runs a local Jupyter notebook.</p>
<h2 id="application-demonstration-using-mnist">Application demonstration using MNIST</h2>
<p>The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology Database
is a machine learning database based on image processing Various MNIST
files involving different machine learning cases were modified and
tested on various local and remote machines These cases include
Multilayer Perceptron, LSTM (Long short-term
memory), Auto-Encoder, Convolutional, and Recurrent Neural
Networks, Distributed Training, and PyTorch training</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/workflow-uml.png" alt="Design for the workflow.">{fig:workflow-uml}</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>The hybrid multi-cloud analytics service framework was
created to ensure running jobs across
many platforms. We designed a small and streamlined number of abstractions so that jobs and workflows can be represented easily. The design is flexible and can be expanded as each job can contain arbitrary arguments. This made it possible to custom design for each target type a specific job type so that execution on local and remote compute resources including batch operating systems can be achieved. The job types supported include:
local job on Linux, macOS, Windows 10, and Windows 11, jobs running in WSL on Windows computers, remote jibs using ssh, and a batch JObs using Slurm.</p>
<p>In addition, we leveraged the exiting Networkx Graph framework to allow dependencies between jobs. This greatly reduced the complexity of the implementation while being able to leverage graphical displays of the workflow, as well as using scheduling jobs with for example topological sort available in Networkx. Custom schedulers can be designed easily based on the dependencies and job types managed through this straightforward interface. The status of the jobs is stored in a database that can be monitored during program execution. The creation of the jobs is done on the fly, e.g. when the job is needed to be determined on the dependencies when all its parents are resolved. This is especially important as it allows dynamic workflow patterns to be implemented while results from previous calculations can be used in later stages of the workflow. </p>
<p>We have developed a simple-to-use API for this so programs can be formulated using the API in python. However, we embedded this API also in a prototype REST service to showcase that integration into language-independent frameworks is possible. The obvious functions to manage workflows are supported including graph specification through configuration files, upload of workflows, export, adding jobs and dependencies, and visualizing the workflow during the execution. An important feature that we added is the monitoring of the jobs while using progress reports through automated log file mining. This way each job reports the progress during the execution. This is especially of importance when we run very complex and long-running jobs.</p>
<p>The REST service was implemented in FastAPI to leverage a small but fast service that features a much smaller footprint for implementation and setup in contrast to other similar REST service frameworks using python.</p>
<p>This architectural component building this framework is depicted  @fig:workflow-uml.
The code is available in this repository and manual pages are provided on how to install it:
<a href="https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-cc">cloudmesh-cc</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The main interaction with the workflow is through the command line.
With the framework, researchers and scientists should be able to
create jobs on their own, place them in the workflow, and run them on
various types of computers.</p>
<p>In addition, developers and users can utilize the built-in OpenAPI
graphical user interface to manage
workflows between jobs. They can be uploaded as YAML files or individually
added through the build-in debug framework.</p>
<p>Improvements to this project will include code cleanup and manual development.</p>
