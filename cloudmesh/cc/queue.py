    This is a program that allows for the instantiation of jobs and then
    allowing those jobs to be manipulated in a queue. These manipulations
    are add, create, remove, list, and run. This way, once a remote computer
    (such as Rivanna) is accessed, the jobs that need to be executed can be).

    Below are the objects and what they can do with examples of the type of
    command that would theoretically be run in the command line.
